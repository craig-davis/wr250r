Converting between the WR250R and the WR250X is a fairly straightforward process. Other than the wheels and tires, the <a href='/articles/differences-between-the-wr250r-and-wr250x.html'>differences between the bikes (read more)</a> are minimal. If you are looking to install aftermarket supermoto wheels such as the set from <a href='http://www.warp9racing.com/sm_wheels_yamaha.html' target='_blank'>Warp 9</a>, you might be able to skip some of the notes below.

One of the primary differences to note other than the wheel size is the front brake assembly. While the wheel hubs are the same between the bikes, the front caliper and rotor are bigger on the X model (R rotor is 250mm, X rotor is 298mm). The X model also has an extra caliper bracket which bolts to the fork. You can see the differences between the two brake assemblys in these diagrams.

	<strong>Notice</strong>: If you are using <a href='http://www.warp9racing.com/sm_wheels_yamaha.html' target='_blank'>Warp 9 supermoto wheels</a>, the front wheel comes with a 240mm rotor instead of the standard WR250X 298mm rotor, so it will fit the stock WR250R caliper assembly.

Overall, you have a few options to handle the rotor size difference when using OEM WR250X wheels 

1. Buy the WR250X caliper assembly, and swap it with the current assembly when you change wheels. This will require you to bleed the front brakes every time you swap.
2. Same as above, except get a second front brake lever and brake line, so you can swap the entire thing out when you change wheels.
3. Buy an EBC 250mm rotor so you can continue to use the existing caliper assembly with the X wheels. (_If someone could confirm this works without a new bracket, that would be great_)

Once you've sorted out your new wheels and brake rotor sizing, you'll notice that the R model kick stand is a bit too long and the bike doesn't lean over quite as much as it used to. This isn't a required change, but I was more comfortable one the bike was leaning over further and had less of a chance of getting knocked the other way. The WR250R kickstand is 13.5" long (part # 3D7-27311-01-00), and the WR250X kickstand is 12" long (part # 3D7-27311-11-00). I ordered a new kickstand and was ready to go, but have heard stories of other people cutting and extending / shortening their kickstands.

Now get out and enjoy your new supermoto!
