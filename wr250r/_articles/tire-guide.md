This is by far the most popular tire setup for the WR250R. The [Pirelli MT21 front tire](/products/tires/mt21-front.html) (90/90R-21) and [Dunlop D606 rear tire](/products/tires/d606-rear.html) (120/90R-18) do great both on and off the street, and they last quite a long time. Riders have reported getting about 5,000 miles (8,000 kms) out of their MT21 front tires and 3,500 miles (5,600 kms) out of their D606 rears.

This primarily dirt setup is increasing in popularity. The Mitas C16 (90/90R-21) and C17 (100/100R-18) have been known to perform very well on both the street and the dirt.
