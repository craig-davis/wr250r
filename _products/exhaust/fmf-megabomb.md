The science behind the Megabomb header may be our greatest engineering accomplishment to date. You can bolt on a Megabomb with an existing FMF Racing slip on for as much as a 3hp boost, plus the Megabomb actually reduces noises levels by as much as 1.5dB. The Megabomb technology is revolved to produce more low end to mid range gains as well as broadening out the mid to top end power gains over stock. The Megabomb is best used for Motocross/Supercross and GNCC style trails.

* Produces long header torque and short header over-rev
* Reduces sound output as much as 1.5dB
* Increases output from stock motor as much as 3hp
* Made from premium American TiMetal material
