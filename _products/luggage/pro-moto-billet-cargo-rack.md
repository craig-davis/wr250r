* Like other Pro Moto Billet products, "Rack-It" cargo racks are a work of art.
* Not only are they functional, they look good too. Each rack is CNC-machined from a 1/2-inch thick plate of 6061 billet aluminum.
* The rack is then "hard clear" anodized for durability, ease of maintenance, and protection from the elements.
* Pro Moto Billet uses only stainless steel fasteners to provide carefree maintenance.
* Most racks require no major modifications to mount. All necessary mounting hardware and installation instructions included.
