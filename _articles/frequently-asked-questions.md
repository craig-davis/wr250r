## What are the best free performance mods?

Most WR owners like to start by removing the airbox flapper, the ais system, and the exup emissions system. These quick and dirty mods will definitely give your bike a bit more spunk, and shouldn't take more than an hour!

## What are the best tires for the WR250R?

The [Pirelli MT21 front tire](/products/tires/mt21-front.html) and [Dunlop D606 rear tire](/products/tires/d606-rear.html) are generally regarded as the best all around dual sport tire setup.

## What are the best tires for the WR250X?

The Avon Distanzia tires ([front](/products/tires/distanzia-front.html) and [rear](/products/tires/distanzia-rear.html)) set is a great street focused dual sport tire for the WR250X. It definitely gets the job done offroad, while still manaing to be plenty sticky on the street.

## What is the best exhaust package?

The [FMF Q4 exhaust](/products/exhaust/fmf-q4.html) paired with the [FMF Megabomb header](/products/exhaust/fmf-megabomb.html) will give you the best performance package and sound upgrade for your money.

## Are there any common issues I should worry about?

Not particularly. The 2008 model does have a known issue with the fuel pump, which you may need to replace at some point.
